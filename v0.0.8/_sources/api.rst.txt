=============

QUGaR is a library for generating quadrature points for unfitted domain methods.
It is written in C++20 and all its functionalities can be accessed through the C++ API.
The Python API is a thin wrapper around the C++ API and it is not as complete as the C++ version.
However it provides some extra features for solving PDEs using unfitted discretizations, passing the generated quadratures to `FEniCSx <https://fenicsproject.org>`_ through its Python interface.
