.. QUGaR demos

Demos
=====

These demos illustrate QUGaR usage. Starting with
:doc:`Divergence theorem demo <generated/demos/demo_div_thm>` is recommended.
If you are interested in solving PDEs using FEniCSx, suggested next
steps are :doc:`Poisson problem <generated/demos/demo_poisson>` and
:doc:`linear elasticity problem <generated/demos/demo_elasticity>`.
