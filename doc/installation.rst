.. QUGaR installation docs

Installation
============

Right now, QUGaR can only be installed from its sources.
In the near future we will provide a conda package to ease the process.
Alternatively, you can use the a Docker image, as described below.

Source
------

QUGaR is composed by two main components: the C++ core and an (optional)  Python interface.


Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

C++ core
********

The C++ core can be installed without Python as a dependency.

.. rubric:: Required

- C++ compiler (supporting the C++20 standard)
- `CMake <https://cmake.org>`_
- `Algoim <https://algoim.github.io>`_ (automatically downloaded and installed during the CMake configuration process)

.. rubric:: Optional

- `The LAPACKE C Interface to LAPACK <https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html>`_ (this is an optional dependency, but strongly recommended. If not found, built-in eigenvalue solvers will be used)
- `Catch2 <https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2>`_ (required for testing. If not found, it is automatically downloaded and installed during the CMake configuration process)

.. rubric:: Optional static analysis tools for developers

- `Cppcheck <http://cppcheck.sourceforge.net/>`_
- `Clang-Tidy <https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/>`_


Python interface
****************

Below are additional requirements for the Python interface to the C++
core. Except for FEniCSx, all dependencies can be automatically installed
during the Python package installation process.

.. rubric:: Required

- `Python3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_
- `nanobind <https://pypi.org/project/nanobind/>`_
- `scikit-build-core[pyproject] <https://pypi.org/project/scikit-build-core/>`_
- `NumPy <https://pypi.org/project/numpy/>`_

.. rubric:: Optional

- `FEniCSx <https://fenicsproject.org>`_ (check the file ``python/pyproject.toml`` for required version compatibility)
- `VTK <https://pypi.org/project/vtk/>`__

.. rubric:: Optional for testing

- `pytest <https://pypi.org/project/pytest/>`_

.. rubric:: Optional for linting

- `mypy <https://pypi.org/project/mypy/>`_
- `ruff <https://pypi.org/project/ruff/>`_

Documentation generation
************************
Except for Doxygen, all the below dependencies can be automatically installed
during the Python interface installation process, or using the ``doc/requirements.txt`` file.

.. rubric:: Required

- `Doxygen <https://www.doxygen.nl>`_
- `sphinx <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`_
- `sphinx-rtd-dark-mode <https://pypi.org/project/sphinx-rtd-dark-mode/>`_
- `breathe <https://pypi.org/project/breathe/>`_
- `jupytext <https://pypi.org/project/jupytext/>`_
- `markdown <https://pypi.org/project/Markdown/>`_
- `myst_parser <https://pypi.org/project/myst-parser/>`_

Building and installing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

First clone the repository and go inside::

    git clone https://github.com/pantolin/qugar.git
    cd qugar

C++ core
********
To build and install the C++ library, from the ``qugar/`` root directory run::

    cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -B build -S cpp/
    cmake --build build --parallel 4
    cmake --install build

The following options can be appended to the first ``cmake`` command:

- ``-DBUILD_TESTING=ON``: to build C++ tests.
- ``-Dqugar_WITH_DEMOS=ON``: for building some basic demos.
- ``-Dqugar_DEVELOPER_MODE=ON``: for activating multiple compiler options, including sanitizers. This option is automatically activated when compiling in Debug mode.
- ``-DLAPACKE_DIR=<lapacke-path>``: to provide the specific path to LAPACKE. Some algorithms can benefit from the use of `LAPACKE <https://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html>`_ for solving eigenvalue problems. For instance, when finding roots of polynomials. If LAPACKE is not found during the configuration the message ``LAPACKE not found. Algoim's eigenvalue solvers will be used.`` is displayed.
- ``-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<my-install-path>``: to provide a specific installation path.
- ``-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=<my-c++-commpiler-path>``: to provide a specific C++ compiler.
- etc.

Optionally, it is possible to use CMakePresets. For doing so create ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` files both in the root folder and in the ``cpp/`` and invoke ``cmake`` as::

    cmake --preset=<preset-name> -B build -S cpp/

Examples of both ``CMakeUserPresets.json`` files can be found in the root folder and the ``cpp/`` folders under the names ``CMakeUserPresets.json.template``.

Python
******

QUGaR's Python interface requires the C++ library. So before installing the Python interface, make sure you have the C++ library installed.

To build and install the Python interface, under the ``qugar/`` root directory run::

    python3 -m pip -v install -r ./python/build-requirements.txt
    python3 -m pip -v install --no-build-isolation ./python -U

Optional dependencies, including the documentation dependencies (see below), can be installed by replacing the last line with::

    python3 -m pip -v install --no-build-isolation ./python[all]

QUGaR's Python interface is designed to interact nicely with `FEniCSx <https://fenicsproject.org>`_. Check the Demos page examples.
So, if you want to solve your PDEs using unfitted domains through FEniCSx, make sure to install a compatible version of `DOLFINx <https://github.com/FEniCS/dolfinx>`_.


However, it is also possible to use QUGaR's Python interface without DOLFINx (check the demos page for examples).

QUGaR's Python interface provides some extra visualization features through the `VTK <https://vtk.org>`__ library. To enable such features, install `vtk` (for instance, from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/vtk/>`__ or `conda-forge <https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/vtk>`__). However, be aware that in the mid-future, VTK  dependency will be replaced by `pyvista <https://pyvista.org>`_.


Documentation
*************

Once the QUGaR's Python interface has been installed (and the C++ library), the documentation can be built and installed as follows::

    cd doc
    python3 -m pip -v install -r requirements.txt
    python3 build_docs.py

The documentation will be generated in the ``pages/`` directory.

Note that Doxygen must be installed in your system to build the documentation.

Documentation for the `main` branch can be found `here <https://pantolin.github.io/qugar/main/index.html>`_.

Docker
------

It is also possible to use QUGaR from a Docker container.
The docker file may be built and run from the ``qugar/`` root directory as::

    docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t qugar .
    docker run -it -v $(pwd):/root/shared -w /root/shared qugar bash -i
