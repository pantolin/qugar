    This class provides (abstract) methods for accessing the cut, full,
    and empty cells and facets of the mesh. It also provides methods for
    creating quadrature rules for the cut cells and facets, as well as
    for unfitted boundaries.

    Classes that inherit from this class should implement the
    `get_cut_cells`, `get_full_cells`, `get_empty_cells`, `get_cut_facets`,
    `get_full_facets`, and `get_empty_facets` methods
    to access the cut, full, empty cells and facets, and the cells
    containing unfitted boundaries, respectively. The `create_quad_custom_cells`,
    `create_quad_unf_boundaries`, and `create_quad_custom_facets` methods
    should be implemented to create custom quadrature rules for the cut
    cells and unfitted boundaries.

    This class also provides methods for creating subdomain data for the
    different types of cells and faces.

    Note:
        This class is purely abstract and should not be instantiated
        directly. It is intended to be used as a base class for other
        classes that implement the abstract methods.
